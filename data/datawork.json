I've started comparing census data to school data in order to identify which zoned elementary schools are \"richer or poorer\" than their surrounding neighborhood. The goal is to find school zones that are ripe for policy changes to encourage better economic integration. For example, on the Upper West Side, there are zones that pull from entirely different socioeconomic levels (due to housing projects), so schools only a few blocks away from each other are dramatically different. Based on my preliminary research, I think there are about 100 zones where policy changes (e.g. rezoning, \"controlled choice\") can mitigate the effect of residential segregation on school segregation.

We are using a public data release of about half of all the works in the MoMAs vast collection to help art and design students familiarize themselves with computational approaches to art research. There's a tutorial and then they work in teams using MoMA collections data and their new skills to come up with research and curiosity questions about trends in art collecting, curating, artists, benefactors, media used, size of the works, etc. It's free for students, should be fun 2 day event on February 19-20th and anyone who is curious about art collections data can apply here, even if they have no experience dealing with 'data' and are maybe a little intimidated by that word.","contactName":"","contactEmail":""},{"organizationName":"MasterCard Fashion Hack Challenge","url":"http://newsroom.mastercard.com/photos/mastercard-and-parsons-fashion-hack-challenge/","dataSource":false,"dataResources":false,"dataCompetition":true,"newSchool":true,"position":false,"unpaidPosition":false,"parttimePosition":false,"fulltimePosition":false,"grantFellowship":false,"eligibleAcademic":false,"dateAdded":"1/27/16","timeSensitive":false,"description":"a one day team based Tech challenge taking place at Parsons on Saturday, March 5th, 2016.
