    	<h2>Weekly Assignment 8</h2>
    	<h3>Due 11/9 at 4:00pm</h3>

        <p>Continue working with <a target="_blank" href='https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/spreadsheets/d/1GnsiE3UzUn6lVBBVWGbQnI9FhRGsS1pcmDOBCCMKuoI/edit?usp=sharing'>the sensor you chose in class</a>.</p>

        <h4></h4>
        <p>Decide how you will structure data from your sensors into a table (or multiple tables) in a SQL database. Use these decisions to define a data model/schema for your table(s). Be very specific about the <a target="_blank" href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype.html'>data types</a> you will use for each column. Use <a target="_blank" href='https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/spreadsheets/d/1D2Th7NcF3xY2ZkBMUcr3j08pCHghmUajKI-3wQ_yWIo/edit?usp=sharing'>this template</a>, which shows a fictitious example with two tables. One table collects sensor values and the date and time the sensor value is collected. The other table contains weather observations and the date the observation was collected. The tables could be joined on the date column.</p>

        <p>Think about how to collect the maximum amount of data with the minimum data storage footprint. Your data model/schema should plan for a normalized relational database.</p>


        <h4>Setting up for assignments 8 and 9</h4>

        <p>You will use Amazon Web Services to host your PostgreSQL database server. Complete steps one and two in <a target="_blank" href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html'>this guide for setting up Amazon Relational Database Service</a>. Step <a target="_blank" href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html#CHAP_SettingUp.SignUp'>one</a> is "Sign Up for AWS." Step <a target="_blank" href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html#CHAP_SettingUp.IAM'>two</a> is "Create an IAM User." Follow the instructions for these two steps; it should take about 30 minutes. Note: in signing up for AWS, you must provide a credit card. However, we will not be using any services that will result in a charge to the card that you provide. </p>
