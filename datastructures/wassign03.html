    	<h2>Weekly Assignment 3</h2>
    	<h3>Due 9/28 at 4:00pm</h3>

        <p>You're going to continue working with the addresses you parsed last week from <a target="_blank" href='http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/'>http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/</a></p>

    		<ol>
		<li>First, instead of logging the addresses to the console (as you did in the previous assignment), push them to an array so that it will be easier to access the data for your work on this assignment.<p>[<a target="_blank" href='https://gist.github.com/aaronxhill/38067bb58805896fdbb5'>GIST: pushing to an array</a>]</p></li>
        <li>Write a program that makes a request to the Google Maps API for <em>each</em> address, using the data you scraped in the last assignment.</li>
        <li>You'll need to do some work on the address data (using code!) to prepare them for the API queries. For example, the parsed value "<span class='code'>50 Perry Street, Ground Floor,</span>" should be modified to "<span class='code'>50 Perry Street, New York, NY</span>". And for use in the Google Maps API, it should be further modified to <span class='code'>50+Perry+Street,+New+York,+NY</span>. The addresses are messy and may yield weird results from the API response. Don't worry too much about this right now. But, start to think about it; in a later assignment we'll have to clean these up.<p>[<a target="_blank" href='https://gist.github.com/aaronxhill/e44cade3e426349470b5'>GIST: modifying this address data in preparation for the Google Maps API</a>]</p></li>
        <li>Your final output should be an array that contains an object for each meeting at <a target="_blank" href='http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/meetinglist.cfm?zone=02&borough=M'>http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/meetinglist.cfm?zone=02&borough=M</a>. 
The array should have a length equal to the number of meetings. Each object should hold the relevant data for each meeting. For now, we're focusing on the addresses and their geocoordinates. An example:<div class='code'>
[ { address: '63 Fifth Ave, New York, NY', <br>
    latLong: { lat: 40.7353041, lng: -73.99413539999999 } },<br>
  { address: '16 E 16th St, New York, NY',<br>
    latLong: { lat: 40.736765, lng: -73.9919024 } },<br>
  { address: '2 W 13th St, New York, NY',<br>
    latLong: { lat: 40.7353297, lng: -73.99447889999999 } } ]
</div><p>Save the array as a text file. </p></li>

<li>Be mindful of:
<ul>
<li>API <a target="_blank" href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-limits'>rate limits</a></li>
<li>Asyncronous JavaScript (but don't overuse setTimeout)</li>
<li>Keeping your API key off of GitHub (use a Linux environment variable instead)</li>
<li>Keeping only the data you need from the API response, not all the data</li>
</ul></li>

        <li>Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s) </li>
        <li>Submit the relevant file(s) to Canvas</li>
        <li>Submit to Canvas the URL for your GitHub repository</li>

			</ol>
